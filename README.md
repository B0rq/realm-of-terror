_This map (Realm of Terror) was designed by Borq and made for Project Diablo 2 (PD2). I do not work for PD2 nor do I collect a wage. I am a fan of the private server and wish there was more content. So, why not create some. Making maps is easy if I can do it so can you._

See me building maps in action or suggest an idea on [My Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/b0rq) or locate me in the Pd2 Discord in the `#map-editing-chat`.
